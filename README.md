### The Tinco Project

**Warning:** if you want to give these experimental programs a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don't want or need. Do not blindly use my source code unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

### What is the project about?

The Tinco Project is my research down at the metal. My primarily programming languages are Assembly, C, C++, and Rust, but I am also curious about and experimenting with HareLang, and ZigLang. This project focuses on low-level system programming and hardware driver development.

### Behind the codename

I have been an enormous fan of the epic high-fantasy novels "The Hobbit" and "Lord of the Rings" by the English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien ever since I read the books as a child. Later in life when I read Tolkien's legendarium mythopoeic writings that formed the background to his novels, I began to name my projects after the characters, objects, and geographical names of middle-earth. The word "tinco" is a noun and means "metal" in Quenya, an elvish language spoken by the non-Telerin Elves who reached Valinor. I thought "tinco" would be apt codename for this project since it is about my research down at the metal.
