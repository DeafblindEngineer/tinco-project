### Assembly Language

As part of my research down at the metal this section of the "Tinco Project" repository is a place for me to document my journey to learn the basics of assembly programming from scratch, and eventually gain enough understanding on assembly programming from where I can take myself to higher levels of expertise. To achieve this goal, I am working my way through a several book: 

* "Low-Level Programming: C, Assembly, and Program Execution on IntelÂ® 64 Architecture" by Igor Zhirkov.
* "x64 Assembly Language Step-by-Step: Programming with Linux" by Jeff Duntemann
* "Beginning x64 Assembly Programming: From Novice to AVX Professional" by Jo Van Hoey
* "Mastering Assembly Programming: From instruction set to kernel module with Intel processor" by Alexey Lyashko
* "Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming: Covers x86 64-bit, AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512" by Daniel Kusswurm
* "Guide to Assembly Language: A Concise Introduction" by James T. Streib
