### C Language

I am no stranger to writing programs in the C Language, but I am no master of the language. To become more proficient in writing C, especially down at the metal am working my way through a series of books and documenting my progress in this section of the "Tinco Project" repository. The books I am currently reading are:

* "Low-Level Programming: C, Assembly, and Program Execution on IntelÂ® 64 Architecture" by Igor Zhirkov.
* "The C Programming Language" by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan
* "Effective C: An Introduction to Professional C Programming" by Robert C. Seacord
* "C Pocket Reference: C Syntax and Fundamentals" by Peter Prinz
* "Pointers in C Programming: A Modern Approach to Memory Management, Recursive Data Structures, Strings, and Arrays" by Thomas Mailund
